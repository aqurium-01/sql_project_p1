# sql_project_p1 overview

## Introduction

For this project, I wanted to explore a music store database and see what kind of interesting patterns I could find. Using SQL, I worked on extracting and analyzing the data to understand things like sales, customer choices, and which artists are the most popular.

My main aim was to get a better idea of what drives sales and how customers behave. I looked at things such as top-selling tracks, spending habits, and popular genres. I also tried to spot trends that show what factors might be affecting sales the most.

## What I Found

1.Customer preferences

2.Spending patterns

3.Market trends

## Dataset

The data I used came in CSV format and had several tables:

Customers – basic details about customers like name, contact info, and country.

Invoices – details about each purchase, including who bought it, billing info, and the total price.

InvoiceLines – what each invoice contained, like track ID, quantity, and price per unit.

Tracks – information about each track, including its name, album ID, and genre ID.

Albums – album names and which artist they belong to.

Artists – names of artists.

Genres – names of genres.

This data gave me a good view of how the store works so I could practice writing SQL queries and answering real-life business questions.
